# CombineMulti3DAnimation
Testing how to display a continuous animation with .glb files and three.js

# Method
- blender : making an animation library for an object and saving as .glb file
- three.js : load the .glb file and show the animation
- html : make a simple webpage for displaying

# In three.js, you need...
- Scene: The scene is a container that holds all the objects, lights, and cameras to be rendered. It's where you define the positions, rotations, and sizes of objects in your 3D world.
- Camera: The camera determines which parts of the scene will be rendered onto the screen. 
- Renderer: It creates a canvas element and renders the scene using the camera's position and angle, as well as the effects of lights in the scene, to generate the final image.
